Background<br>
Ensuring clients with capability to pay will not be rejected when submitting loan: addressed using machine learning classification model

Several conclusion for this project:<br>
* The best model is logistic regression model with `Recall = 0.65` and `AUC = 0.65`. This metrics are chosen because the dataset was highly imbalanced.
* Imbalanced dataset handling with undersampling and oversampling and hyperparameter tuning did not have better result.
